Under the `Choose payment methods` section, you can select the way(s) in which you want to be paid. Currently, payments made 
through PayPal and Stripe are accepted as online methods, but offline procedures such as paying by Cheque, Bank Transfer/TT or
paying upon arrival at the event are also available.

If you find yourself in a situation where you need to charge an amount of money 
on your tickets, an `Add Tax` option is available. Besides filling in the country and some details about the tax you're applying, you can also choose whether the tax will be included in the ticket price, or added as a separate fee.
